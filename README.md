# xsphere Slow Control

Slow control system for the xsphere cryostat experiment at Yale University.
Monitors and controls temperatures, LN2 fill levels, and gas handling for a
xenon cryostat used in levitated-particle physics experiments.

## What this system does

- **Reads temperatures** from the CLICK PLC (RTDs at the cryostat zones, base
  + clamps) and the LabJack T7 (cube RTDs + four type-K gradiometer TCs)
- **Controls heaters** via three PID zones (top / bottom / nozzle) on the PLC,
  with a Python gradient abstraction layer (gradient mode or per-zone absolute)
- **Manages LN2 autofill** for the ballast and primary xenon dewars via solenoid
  valves — the autofill ladder runs on the PLC; the Python service forwards
  level readings and exposes manual/arm controls
- **Monitors pressure and vacuum** from the gas-handling-system (GHS) ESP32
- **Holds a centralized state view** — the StateStore subscribes to every
  source topic, computes per-state freshness + moving averages + derived
  quantities, and republishes a consolidated snapshot on
  `xsphere/state/snapshot` (see [slowcontrol/STATE_LAYER_PLAN.md](slowcontrol/STATE_LAYER_PLAN.md))
- **Watches safety interlocks** — alerts on stale sensors, out-of-range
  temperatures, and saturated heater output
- **Logs everything** to InfluxDB via Telegraf, visualized in Grafana
- **Web GUIs** — a *register* page (everything, read-only) and a *control* page
  (valves, PID, gradient, automation), both schema-driven from the snapshot

## Using the web GUIs

Three browser pages, all served by the same Flask app on `xbox-pi:8088`:

| URL | What it is |
|---|---|
| `http://xbox-pi:8088/` | **Register GUI** — read-out of every state in the system, grouped, with freshness colouring |
| `http://xbox-pi:8088/control` | **Control GUI** — valves, PID, gradient, automation; each control shows the current state next to the input |
| `http://xbox-pi:8088/readme` | This page |
| `http://xbox-pi:3000/d/xsphere-slowcontrol` | **Grafana** — time-series history from InfluxDB |

The slow-control service publishes a consolidated snapshot (`xsphere/state/snapshot`, retained) every second; both GUIs read it via `/api/state` and update at ~1.5 s. If `/api/state` shows `mqtt: DOWN` or `snapshot_age` is large, the slow-control service is the suspect, not the GUI.

### Reading the register page

- Each card is one **group** of states (temperature, level, valve, pid, gradient, service, …).
- Every row shows: a label, the current value, the unit (analog) or yes/no + ● (binary) or the enum value, the moving average if one is configured (e.g. `⌀60s 207.13`), and a freshness chip.
- Freshness colouring:
  - **fresh** — updated within `1.5 × period_s`; trust the value.
  - **stale** (amber) — older than that; sensor probably skipped a few cycles, often clears on its own.
  - **invalid** (dim) — older than `5 × period_s`, or never received since the service started. **Don't trust the displayed value.**
- The header pills (`service`, `interlocks`, `labjack`, `ghs`, `mqtt`, fresh/stale/invalid counts, snapshot age) are the at-a-glance health check.

### Using the control page

Every control widget shows the **current** value of the thing it controls next to the input — the placeholder text in number inputs is the current value when the field is empty, and a small grey line below each control says "current …" so you know what setting the value would change.

**Valves** (one block per vessel — XV3 cryostat, XV2 primary Xe, XV1 ballast)

- "actual" ● = the energised state read back from the PLC; "desired" = the last command sent.
- `Open` / `Close` send the manual command (`xsphere/commands/valve/{vessel}/state`). The currently-desired button is highlighted green.
- `auto-open` / `auto-close` toggle the **PLC ladder's** autofill enables. They do **not** make Python the autofill brain — that's still the PLC. If both are armed, the PLC ladder watches the level and opens/closes the valve when thresholds are crossed (config in `state.yaml` / SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md §6b).
- The Python autovalve controller is **disabled by default** (`config.yaml: autovalve.enabled: false`), to keep a single autofill authority.

**Heaters — PID** (one block per zone — top / bottom / nozzle)

- The summary line shows **PV** (process variable, actual temperature), **SET** (setpoint), **OUT** (heater output 0-100 %), and **err** (PV − SET).
- `setpoint (K)` + `set SP` writes the PID's setpoint register on the PLC.
  - **Important**: this only "sticks" when **gradient mode = absolute**. If gradient mode is `gradient`, the GradientController owns the per-zone setpoints and will overwrite anything you set here on the next gradient command. To control individual zones, switch to absolute first.
- `Kp / Ki / Kd` + `set gains` writes all three at once to the PLC's PID block. There's no commit-on-Tab — you must press the button.

**Gradient**

- `mode`: `gradient` (the GradientController computes the three PID setpoints from base + Δv + Δl) or `absolute` (each zone is set independently via the PID card).
- `base (top, K)` is the top zone's setpoint and the base of the gradient.
- `Δvertical (b−t, K)` adds to base for the bottom zone; `Δlongitudinal (n−t, K)` adds to base for the nozzle zone.
- The "current N K · measured M K" line shows the setpoint Δ and the **measured** Δ from the cube RTDs (the `dt_vertical_meas` / `dt_longitudinal_meas` derived states) — handy for seeing how well the gradient is actually realised.
- The `→ setpoints: top … · bottom … · nozzle …` line is the resulting per-zone setpoints the GradientController is publishing.


**Trackers — keep one state tied to another (+ offset)**

- A *tracker* writes one state to `source + offset` on every tick. Example: `pid_top_setpoint = t_cube_bottom + 10` keeps the top zone's PID setpoint always 10 K above the bottom-cube RTD.
- *target* must be an analog state with a `control:` block in `state.yaml` (every PID setpoint and the gradient parameters qualify); *source* can be any analog state.
- Set `offset = 0` for plain follow ("setpoint = sensor").
- Optional clamp via `min_value` / `max_value` (typed at the MQTT level; not currently in the GUI form).
- **Enabling a tracker writes the target on the next tick** — there's no grace period. Confirm `source + offset` is sane before flipping the toggle.
- Trackers persist to `slowcontrol/trackers.json` and come back on a service restart. Add/remove/enable them via the GUI's "Trackers" card or directly with MQTT: `xsphere/commands/trackers/{set,remove,enable}`.
- A PID-setpoint tracker only sticks when **gradient mode = `absolute`**. In `gradient` mode the GradientController overwrites the per-zone setpoints.

### Sequencer (the third tab)

`http://xbox-pi:8088/sequencer` — build and run an ordered list of steps. Each step is one or more *actions* plus a *hold time*; when the step is entered the actions fire, then it holds for the duration, then advances.

Two kinds of **program item**:

- **Step** — one or more actions plus a hold time. Each action is one of:
  - `set constant` — writes a target state to a number (e.g. `pid_top_setpoint = 170`). Target must be any analog state with a `control:` block in `state.yaml`.
  - `track source + offset` — creates or updates a *sequencer-owned* tracker (id prefix `seq:`) that keeps `target = source + offset` for the duration of this step. When a later step is entered, any sequencer-owned tracker not in that step's track actions is automatically removed.
- **Sweep** — a compact "scan one analog target from `start` to `stop` in increments of `step`, dwelling `dwell` at each value". Expanded inline at run time; one program item, N writes. Replaces the old standalone gradient scanner — sweep `gradient_base` to recover the old behaviour, or sweep `pid_top_setpoint` / `gradient_dv` / anything else with a `control:` block.

Workflow:

1. **Build a step (staging)** — pick a target, pick `set` or `track`, fill in the value (or source + offset), click `+ add action`. Repeat for multiple actions in the same step. Give the step a label + hold (minutes), click `+ add step to program`.
2. **Or add a sweep** — pick a target, fill in start / stop / step (in the target's units, usually K) and the per-point dwell (minutes). The card shows a live preview (`9 points · total 90 min`). Click `+ add sweep to program`.
3. The program list below shows all queued items; sweeps render as one row with `point 4/9` while running.
4. The program is persisted to `slowcontrol/sequencer.json` and survives a service restart.
5. `run` walks the items in order; `stop` aborts at the next check. A progress bar shows remaining time on the current (sub-)step.
6. At end-of-program **the last step's trackers are left in place** — the cryostat stays where the program landed it. Clean up the `seq:*` trackers from the **Control** page if needed.

Sequencer tips:

- Disable any conflicting manual trackers (Control page → Trackers card) before running, or both will write each tick.
- A `set` or `track` targeting `pid_*_setpoint` only sticks when `gradient_mode == absolute`; in `gradient` mode the GradientController overwrites per-zone setpoints. To use the gradient as the lever, target `gradient_base` / `gradient_dv` / `gradient_dl` instead.
- The program is mutable only when *not running* — `set`/`append`/`clear` are rejected with a log warning during a run.

### Adding a new tracked state

Edit `slowcontrol/state.yaml`, add an entry under the right `groups:` (or `derived:`) block, restart the slow-control service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart xsphere-slowcontrol
```

It appears in the register GUI immediately and, if it has a `control:` block, in the control GUI **only if** a card references it (the bespoke cards are hand-wired). Validate the YAML before restarting:

```bash
cd /home/xbox/xsphere-slow-control && python -m slowcontrol.state.schema
```

See `slowcontrol/STATE_LAYER_PLAN.md` for the full field reference.

### Logs and troubleshooting

```bash
# what the service is doing right now
journalctl -u xsphere-slowcontrol -f
journalctl -u xsphere-webcontrol -f

# restart after editing config or state.yaml
sudo systemctl restart xsphere-slowcontrol
sudo systemctl restart xsphere-webcontrol

# read-only Modbus probe of the PLC (safe to run any time)
cd /home/xbox/xsphere-slow-control && python -m slowcontrol.tools.plc_probe
```

Common things and what they mean:

- **Many states INVALID after restart** — wait ~2 s; retained MQTT messages take a moment to redeliver to a fresh subscriber. If they stay invalid, the publisher (PLC driver / LabJack controller / ESP32) is down.
- **A LabJack/PLC restart kills the connection** — drivers reconnect automatically; the corresponding states will go stale then fresh.
- **`pid_*_setpoint` set has no effect** — gradient mode is probably `gradient`; switch to `absolute` first (or use the gradient card).
